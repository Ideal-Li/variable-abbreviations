大家耳熟能详照片格式是.jpg，还有一种我们常常见到的.bmp 格式，对应的就是 `bitmap` 这个单词啦。

#### 二者的[区别(来自google)][1]：

> JPEG is a compressed image format. It is lossy, which means that when you convert BMP to JPEG and back, the pixel values are slightly off. ... A JPEG image can be compressed to about 1% to 5% of the size of a BMP file before the difference becomes noticeable. Most of the images you see on the internet are in JPEG format.

先一起来看看普通词典给出的`bitmap`的英英解释：

> **bitmap**: a computer image formed from **pixels** which are each stored as a value of one or more bits. （位图）

说实话，对一个电脑盲来说，“位图”其实就是中文的`生词`，字都认识，但真的每个人都能用直白的语言向一个不懂术语的对方解释清楚什么是位图吗? 如果你也觉得辛苦，可以参考上面的英英解释的翻译及下面的补充内容。

> **pixel**: A pixel is the smallest area on a computer screen which can be given a separate colour by the computer. （像素）

再来看看微软计算机词典给出的解释：

> **bitmap**: A data structure in memory that represents information in the form of a collection of individual bits. A bit map is used to represent a bit image. Another use of a bit map in some systems is the representation of the blocks of storage on a disk, indicating whether each block is free (0) or in use (1).

> **bit image**: A sequential collection of bits that represents in memory an image to be displayed on the screen, particularly in systems having a graphical user interface. Each bit in a bit image corresponds to one pixel (dot) on the screen. The screen itself, for example, represents a single bit image; similarly, the dot patterns for all the characters in a font represent a bit image of the font. In a black-and-white display each pixel is either white or black, so it can be represented by a single bit. The “pattern” of 0s and 1s in the bit image then determines the pattern of white and black dots forming an image on the screen. In a color display the corresponding description of on-screen bits is called a pixel image because more than one bit is needed to represent each pixel.

> **pixel image**: The representation of a color graphic in a computer’s memory. A pixel image is similar to a bit image, which also describes a screen graphic, but a pixel image has an added dimension, sometimes called depth, that describes the number of bits in memory assigned to each on-screen pixel.
