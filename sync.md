## synchronization


`synchronize`: 剑桥词典给出了两个解释

> **synchronize**: to (cause to) happen at the same time

> **synchronize**: When people synchronize their watches, they make sure that all their watches show the same time

柯林斯词典给出的解释是：
> If you **synchronize** two activities, processes, or movements, or if you **synchronize** one activity, process, or movement **with** another, you cause them to happen at the same time and speed as each other. 

用大白话解释就是: **使同步、使同时发生**。

> 例句： [Medium][1] 上一篇文章的标题为`Synchronize your asynchronous code using JavaScript’s async await`

其次，`synchronization`: 即动词 `synchronize` 的名词形式，很简单。非也，看似简单罢了，中文层面“同步”两个字谁都认识，但其背后的深层语义呢？

微软计算机词典对 `synchronization` 给出了6个解释，来吧，全方位看美女式地全方位看看“同步”这个单词吧：

> 1. In networking, a communications transmission in which multibyte packets of data are sent and received at a fixed rate. （multibyte：多字节；packets：数据包）

> 2. In networking, the matching of timing between computers on the network. All of the computers are generally assigned identical times to facilitate and coordinate communications.

> 3. In a computer, the matching of timing between components of the computer so that all are coordinated. For instance, operations performed by the operating system are generally synchronized with the signals of the machine’s internal clock. 

> 4. In application or database files, version comparisons of copies of the files to ensure they contain the same data. 

> 5. In multimedia, precise **real-time** processing. Audio and video are transmitted over a network in synchronization so that they can be played back together without delayed responses. 
【注意：`real-time` 不要望文生义，不是`真实的时间`喔，而是 “Real-time processing is a type of computer programming or data processing in which the information received is processed by the computer almost immediately.” 】

> 6. In handheld computing, the process of updating or backing up the data on a handheld computer to the linked software applications on a desktop computer. Data changes made on the desktop computer may also be copied to the handheld during synchronization.

再者，`synchronous`: 即“同步”的 adj 形式。`-ous`在英文中往往是形容词词性的后缀，比如名词`danger`的形容词是`dangerous`。

> Occurring at the same time. In computer transmissions, a reference to activity governed by a clock or by synchronized timing.

其实，我们经常看到的`sync`或者`synch`就是 `synchronization` 的简写。

**词组：out of sync / in sync** 的解释如下：

> If two things are **out of sync**, they do not match or do not happen together as they should. If two things are **in sync**, they match or happen together as they should.
